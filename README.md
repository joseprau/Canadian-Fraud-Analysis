## Introduction
This project explores cybersecurity and fraud-related complaints reported to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre between 2015 and 2024. Using detailed case data, we analyze financial losses across different types of fraud, victim age groups, and gender identities. The goal is to uncover demographic patterns, highlight high-impact fraud categories, and present the findings through effective data visualizations. This analysis aims to support awareness and prevention efforts by making the scope and nature of cybercrime in Canada more understandable and actionable.
